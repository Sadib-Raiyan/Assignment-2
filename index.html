          After 28 years of wait, Argentina finally has a trophy as it beat
          Brazil in the final of Copa America 2021 at the Maracana Stadium in
          Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is Argentina's first title since 1993 and
          15th Copa America title. Angel Di Maria's 22nd minute strike proved
          enough as the Albiceleste showed great composure and determination in
          defence to keep the Selecao out, a feat none of the teams have
          achieved in this edition of the tournament.
